# edhrec_json_to_txt
This is a Python program to get all of the cardlists for a given commander from EDHRec and save them as txt files that can be uploaded to sites like Moxfield and MPC fill.
## How to use
1. Download the code. If you don't know anything about Git or Github, just click the green <> Code button and download the zip then extract it. If you know Git then feel free to clone or even fork the repo
2. Run the program. If you don't know Python, just go into dist and run the executable. If you do know Python then run the python file
3. Type in your commander name. Make sure the spelling and spaces are correct. Symbols and capitalization don't matter.
4. Select the folder you want to save the cardlists in

That's it! It will automatically save every different cardlist from EDHRec for your commander including a huge flattened cardlist containing every card called Flat Cardlist. It even creates and Info file with information about the lists which currently shows the card counts for each list.

Now you can take these lists and upload them to Moxfield, MPC Fill and other websites to build your deck or order proxies!
